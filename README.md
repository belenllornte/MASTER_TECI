# MASTER_TECI
This is my academic portfolio for the joint Master's program (TECI) from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) & Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).


## Overview

Welcome! This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of all my projects, coursework, and practical assignments completed during my master.

The TECI program is a specialized, joint-degree master's from two of Spain's leading universities, uniquely bridging the worlds of formal mathematics and applied engineering. It is co-directed by the Faculty of Mathematical Sciences (UCM) and the School of Telecommunications Engineering (UPM). The curriculum focuses on advanced techniques for data analysis, computational modeling, and information processing, taught from both a rigorous theoretical perspective and a practical, hands-on engineering one.

The primary goal of this repository is to:
* Document my learning journey and the practical application of complex theories.
* Organize all academic materials, code, and reports in a clean, accessible structure.
* Showcase my skills in advanced data science, optimization, and computational methods to peers, professors, and potential employers.


## 📚 Coursework & Subjects Covered

This repository is organized into directories by subject. Each folder contains relevant code, datasets, reports, and notes for that course.

Key subjects included are:

* ### Data Mining
    Discovering patterns and extracting valuable knowledge from large datasets. Includes projects on clustering, classification, association rules, and anomaly detection.

* ### Optimization
    Designing and implementing algorithms to find the best solutions for complex problems. Covers linear, non-linear, integer, and heuristic optimization.

* ### Fuzzy Logic
    Exploring "degrees of truth" rather than a binary (true/false) logic. This section includes models for handling ambiguity and uncertainty in decision-making systems.

* ### Numerical Methods in Finance
    Applying computational techniques to solve quantitative problems in finance. Includes projects on risk modeling, option pricing).






## 🛠️ Technology Stack & Tools

The projects in this repository primarily utilize the following technologies and programming languages:

* **Programming Languages:** Python, R
* **Core Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ...
* **Advanced Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, ...
* **Tools & IDEs:** Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio, ...


## 🧭 How to Navigate This Repository

* Each **top-level folder** corresponds to a single subject (e.g., `/Data_Mining`).
* Inside each subject folder, you will find **sub-folders** for specific projects or assignments (e.g., `/Project_1`, `/Homework_3`).


## ⚠️ A Note on Academic Integrity

This repository is public and intended to serve as a **personal portfolio of my work**. The code and solutions provided are my own.

If you are a student currently enrolled in the TECI program or a similar course, you are welcome to use this repository for inspiration and reference. However, **you must not directly copy or submit this work as your own.** Please adhere to the academic integrity policies of the UPM and UCM.
